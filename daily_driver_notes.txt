1. Use zooming in tmux

2. Use marks from vim to look at certain lines of code quickly
  - USE MARKS TO JUMP TO A SPECIFIC, SAVED LINE OF CODE FROM **ANY**
  OTHER FILE (go back to your specific line of code without having to have the file
  open at all after searching somewhere else in your codebase for some info/answers)

3. Use preset tmux pane configs for common situations

4. Use vim editing for long lines of commands

5. Switching panes, windows, and clearing/killing panes/windows.

6. Use "grep -R "<Your desired string here>" " to look for things in a medium-small codebase.
  Know that this only will search the file tree beginning at the directory in which the command is
  run.
